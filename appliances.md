Review
* Tested: Yes, I bought the first pack on 2018. 
* Pros:
  * Budget way to shut on and off things.
  * I don't have problems with the cloud access, it failed me very few times.
  * It has lan mode.
* Cons:
  * It doesn't have sensors to give us power consumption values.
  * You have to cut the cable of the appliance you want to apply it, then you can't remove it easily, and if you do, you will have the cable patched.
* Use cases: For example, I've added it to my table lamps, removing the default interruptors, then I can turn it on and off with the button, or with domotics. I think it is a cheap way to control lamps that you don't need to adjust the brightness.
